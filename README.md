# xoom-redirector

# Note (3/5/2022):
#### Zoom has issued a trademark violation against this extension and had Google remove it from the Chrome webstore. I'd love it if you could give me a [retweet](https://twitter.com/arkadiyt/status/1500141960065028098) or quote tweet and tag Zoom - maybe with enough support they'll reverse their decision. In the meanwhile I have republished the extension under a new name: [Xoom Redirector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xoom-redirector/ocabkmapohekeifbkoelpmppmfbcibna)

### What's it for

When joining a Zoom meeting, the "join from your browser" link is intentionally hidden. This browser extension solves this problem by transparently redirecting any meeting links to use Zoom's browser based web client.
